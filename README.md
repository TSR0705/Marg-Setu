> 🚀 **Marg Setu** is a visionary web application built to empower young entrepreneurs by connecting them with potential investors, mentors, accelerators, and growth resources — all under one digital roof.

## 🌟 The Vision

In a world brimming with ideas, one of the biggest challenges for early-stage entrepreneurs is **access** — to capital, guidance, resources, and visibility. **Marg Setu** is our attempt to bridge that gap — a **digital bridge** that connects bold thinkers with the people and opportunities that can bring their ideas to life.

Built with **React** and **pure CSS**, this platform is currently in active development, with the frontend handled in this repository and the backend collaboratively built and maintained by our development partner.
